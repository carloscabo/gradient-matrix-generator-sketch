1. Draw as many rectangles as many colors you want to combine.
2. Fill them with the corresponding colors
3. Place them **OUTSIDE the artboard**.
4. Run the plugin the the menÃº option `ðŸŒˆ Gradient matrix generator / Generate matrix from selection`
5. You'll get a fresh artboard with the resulting gradients.

You can take a look to the sample `test.sketch` file in this repository.

### Configuration and tweaks

- The spacing between the gradient's matrix elements will be the same as the **spacing between the first two elements in the selection.**
- The proportions of the resulting rectangles will be the same proportions of the **first element in the selection.**
- You can get circles instead of squares / rectangles simply **rounding the resulting shapes corners.**

### Info & feedback

This my very first Sketch plugin, don't expect superb-fancy-state-of-the-art coding. If you have any questions / suggestions you can find me at Twitter ([@putuko](https://twitter.com/putuko)). This is an open source plugin so pull request and collaborations are welcome. Greetz.
